0,1,1000,Wolfgang Bibel,Dual Recurrent Attention Units for Visual Question Answering,1989,"When two or more distinct organizations interconnect their internal computer networks they form an Inter-Organization Network(ION). IONs support the exchange of cad/cam data between manufacturers and subcontractors, software distribution from vendors to users, customer input to suppliers' order-entry systems, and the shared use of expensive computational resources by research laboratories, as examples. This paper analyzes the technical implications of interconnecting networks across organization boundaries.After analyzing the organization context in which IONs are used, we demonstrate that such interconnections are not satisfied by traditional network design criteria of connectivity and transparency. To the contrary, a primary high-level requirement is access control, and participating organizations must be able to limit connectivity and make network boundaries visible. We describe a scheme based on non-discretionary control which allows interconnecting organizations to combine gateway, network, and system-level mechanisms to enforce cross-boundary control over invocation and information flow, while minimizing interference with internal operations.Access control requirements such as these impose new requirements on the underlying interconnection protocols. We demonstrate such alternative interconnection protocols that support loose coupling across administrative boundaries and that accommodate the necessary control mechanisms. Message-based gateways that support non-real-time invocation of services (e.g., file and print servers, financial transactions, VLSI design tools, etc.) are a promising basis for such loose couplings.",Jean-Marie Nicolas,1001,83

  Response Generation",1989,"In distributed systems surveillance protocols are used for monitoring the status of remote sites. A remote site is regarded as being available as long as messages are received from this site, otherwise it is regarded as being unavailable. If a site becomes unavailable, this will be reported to other sites and recovery actions can be initiated. Using an example it will be shown that in certain cases it is necessary, that whenever some site S1 detects the unavailability of some other site S2, within a fixed amount of time S2 must also have detected an unavailability of S1. Unfortunately, this cannot be guaranteed by existing surveillance protocols. Another problem with existing protocols is, that remote sites are usually reported as being unavailable after being timed out only once, i.e. the loss of just one message might cause complete systems to back out.Two versions of a protocol for so-called symmetric surveillance are presented. Both guarantee, that if S1 detects the unavailability of S2 at time t0, then S2 (provided that S2 has not crashed) will become aware of this fact at t1 such that [t1 - t0]",M. Wallace,1003,21

An alternative method based on the preflow concept of Karzanov is introduced. A preflow is like a flow, except that the total amount flowing into a vertex is allowed to exceed the total amount flowing out. The method maintains a preflow in the original network and pushes local flow excess toward the sink along what are estimated to be shortest paths. The algorithm and its analysis are simple and intuitive, yet the algorithm runs as fast as any other known method on dense graphs, achieving an O(n3) time bound on an n-vertex graph. By incorporating the dynamic tree data structure of Sleator and Tarjan, we obtain a version of the algorithm running in O(nm log(n2/m)) time on an n-vertex, m-edge graph. This is as fast as any known method for any graph density and faster on graphs of moderate density. The algorithm also admits efficient distributed and parallel implementations. A parallel implementation running in O(n2log n) time using n processors and O(m) space is obtained.

Other natural heuristics, such as the transpose and frequency count rules, do not share this property. We generalize our results to show that move-to-front is within a constant factor of optimum as long as the access cost is a convex function. We also study paging, a setting in which the access cost is not convex. The paging rule corresponding to move-to-front is the �least recently used� (LRU) replacement rule.

This problem calls for preprocessing a polygonal subdivision of the plane defined by n line segments so that, given a sequence of points, the polygon containing each point can be determined quickly on-line. Several ways of solving this problem in O(log n) query time and O(n) space are known, but they are all rather complicated. We propose a simple O(log n)-query-time, O(n)-space solution, using persistent search trees. A persistent search tree differs from an ordinary search tree in that after an insertion or deletion, the old version of the tree can still be accessed. We develop a persistent form of binary search tree that supports insertions and deletions in the present and queries in the past. The time per query or update is O(log m), where m is the total number of updates, and the space needed is O(1) per update.

A common thread among these virtual worlds is a direct manipulation user interface paradigm based on a glove device with the position and orientation of the hand registered by a tracking device. To explore this paradigm, a new project at IBM Research was started in 1989 to build a virtual laboratory for scientists and engineers. Our first step is to integrate the glove and space tracking devices with the real time graphics on a graphics superworkstation. A simple bouncing ball virtual world has been created to test underlying software and fine tune interactive performance.Our initial emphasis is placed on understanding the limitations of various system components and getting the best interactive performance from the system. With current state of technology, the glove and tracking devices can generate much more data than the graphics update process can utilize. Both the rendering process and the processes handling the device serial ports are CPU intensive. Our first design problem is how to distribute the processing and match the incoming data rates of input devices with the update rate of the graphics. After a new position from the tracker is received by the graphics, it is displayed only at the next frame update time giving the appearance that the hand image always lags behind the motion of the real hand.

Rendering only the potentially visible subset associated with the current viewpoint, rather than the entire model, produces significant speedups on real building models. Solutions for the radiosity lighting model are pre-computed for up to twenty different sets of lights. Linear combinations of these solutions can be manipulated in real time.

This paper summarizes the entire project---the four systems, the evaluation experiments, the results, and our observations. The molecular docking system results are new.Our principal conclusions are:� Haptic display as an augmentation to visual display can improve perception and understanding both of force fields and of world models populated with impenetrable objects.� Whereas man-machine systems can outperform computer-only systems by orders of magnitude on some problems, haptic-augmented interactive systems seem to give about a two-fold performance improvement over purely graphical interactive systems. Better technology may give somewhat more, but a ten-fold improvement does not seem to be in the cards.� Chemists using GROPE-III can readily reproduce the true docking positions for drugs whose docking is known (but not to them) and can find very good docks for drugs whose true docks are unknown. The present tool promises to yield new chemistry research results; it is being actively used by research chemists.� The most valuable result from using GROPE-III for drug docking is probably the radically improved situation awareness that serious users report. Chemists say they have a new understanding of the details of the receptor site and its force fields, and of why a particular drug docks well or poorly.� We see various scientific/education applications for haptic displays but believe entertainment, not scientific visualization, will drive and pace the technology.� The hardware-software system technology we have used is barely adequate, and our experience sets priorities for future development.� Some unexpected perceptual phenomena were observed.

A routing scheme should use as short as possible paths for routing messages in the network, while keeping the routing information stored in the processors' local memory as succinct as possible. The efficiency of a routing scheme is measured in terms of its stretch factor - the maximum ratio between the length of a route computed by the scheme and that of a shortest path connecting the same pair of vertices.Most previous work has concentrated on finding good routing schemes (with a small fixed stretch factor) for special classes of network topologies. In this work we study the problem for general networks, and look at the entire range of possible stretch factors. The results exhibit a tradeoff between the efficiency of a routing scheme and its space requirements. We present almost tight upper and lower bounds for this tradeoff. Specifically, we prove that any routing scheme for general n-vertex networks that achieves a stretch factor k ? 1 must use a total of &OHgr;(n1+1/2k+4) bits of routing information in the networks. This lower bound is complemented by a family H(k) of hierarchical routing schemes (for every fixed k ? 1), which guarantee a stretch factor of &Ogr;(k), require storing a total of &Ogr;(n1+1/k) bits of routing information in the network and name the vertices with &Ogr;(log2 n)-bit names.",David Peleg,1040,15

We describe a fast algorithm for state differentiation based on this representation. The input as well as the state space is implicitly enumerated through a process of repeated cube intersections to generate the State Transition Graph (STG).In contrast to previous approaches, this algorithm can be efficiently generalized for verifying distributed-style specifications of interacting sequential circuits, exploiting the nature of the interconnection topology. Pipeline latches in a distributed-style specification typically do not add complexity to the sequential behavior of a circuit, but greatly add to the complexity of traditional approaches to verifying sequential circuits. Pipeline latches are easily incorporated into our generalized, hierarchical verification strategy whereby the states of pipeline latches can be implicitly enumerated.Experimental results indicate the superior efficiency of this approach as compared to previous approaches for FSM verification.

In the usual representations of an n-node graph, the names of the nodes (i.e. integers from 1 to n) betray nothing about the graph itself. Indeed, the names (or labels) on the n nodes are just logn bit place holders to allow data on the edges to code for the structure of the graph. In our scenario, there is no such waste. By assigning &Ogr;(logn) bit labels to the nodes, we completely code for the structure of the graph, so that given the labels of two nodes we can test if they are adjacent in time linear in the size of the labels. Furthermore, given an arbitrary original labeling of the nodes, we can find structure coding labels (as above) that are no more than a small constant factor larger than the original labels. These notions are intimately related to vertex induced universal graphs of polynomial size. For example, we can label planar graphs with structure coding labels of size n. This implies the existence of a graph with n4 nodes that contains all n-node planar graphs as vertex induced subgraphs (It was not previously known that this class had polynomial sized universal graphs).

  Comprehension",1991,"The problem of test generation for non-scan sequential VLSI circuits is addressed. A novel method of test generation that efficiently generates test sequences for stuck-at faults in the logic circuit by exploiting register-transfer-level (RTL) design information is presented. Our approach is targeted at chips with data-path like STG.The problem of sequential test generation is decomposed into three subproblems of combinational test generation, fault-free state justification and fault-free state differentiation. Standard combinational test generation algorithms are used to generate test vectors for stuck-at faults in the logic-level implementation. The required state corresponding to the test vector is justified using a fault-free justification step that is performed using the RTL specification. Similarly, if the effect of the fault has been propagated by the test vector to the flip-flop inputs alone, the faulty state produced is differentiated from the true next state by a differentiation step that uses the RTL specification.New and efficient algorithms for fault-free state justification and differentiation on RTL descriptions that contain arithmetic as well as random logic modules are described. Unlike previous approaches, this approach does not require the storage of covers or a partial STG and can be used to generate tests for entire chips without scan. Exploiting RTL information, together with a new conflict resolution technique results in improvements of up to 100X in performance over sequential test generation techniques restricted to operate at the logic level.

Tautology based schemes are generally slower and often give somewhat inferior results, because of a limited global picture of the way in which the cube can be expanded. If the offset is used, usually the expansion can be done quickly and in a more global way because it is easier to see effective directions of expansion. The problem with this approach is that there are many functions that have a reasonable size onset and don't care set but the offset is unreasonably large.

Since the area constrained fanout problem is NP-complete and area is not a major consideration in present high density designs, we restrict our attention to the simpler problem of designing fast fanout circuits without any area constraint. The proposed algorithm builds the fanout tree by partitioning the fanout signals into subsets and then recursively solving each sub-problem. At each stage the algorithm generates a fanout tree that is an improvement over the previous stage. This feature allows the user to specify the improvement desired by the fanout correction process.

It is fail-safe, maximizes workstation autonomy, and is well suited to a network with slow, unreliable, and/or expensive communications links.The algorithm is a manipulation of queries, which are represented as short encodings. When a response is generated, we record which portion of the source database was used. Later, when the source data are updated, this information is used to identify obsolete replicas. For each workstation, the identity of obsolete replicas is saved until a workstation process asks for this information. This workstation process deletes each obsolete replica, and replaces it by an up-to-date version either promptly or the next time the application asks for this particular item.

Consens,DopeLearning: A Computational Approach to Rap Lyrics Generation,1990,"The video presentation �The G+/GraphLog Visual Query System� gives an overview of the capabilities of the ongoing implementation of the G+ Visual Query System for visualizing both data and queries as graphs. The system provides an environment for expressing queries in GraphLog [Con89, CM89, CM90], as well as for browsing, displaying and editing graphs. The visual query system also supports displaying the answers in several different ways.Graphs are a very natural representation for data in many application domains, for example, transportation networks, project scheduling, parts hierarchies, family trees, concept hierarchies, and Hypertext. From a broader perspective, many databases can be naturally viewed as graphs. In particular, any relational database in which we can identify one or more sets of objects of interest and relationships between them can be represented by mapping these objects into nodes and relationships into edges. In the case of semantic and object-oriented databases, there is a natural mapping of objects to nodes and attributes to edges.GraphLog is a visual query language, based on a graph representation of both data and queries, that has evolved from the earlier language G+ [CMW87, CMW89, MW89]. GraphLog queries ask for patterns that must be present or absent in the database graph. Each such pattern, called a query graph, defines new edges that are added to the graph whenever the pattern is found. GraphLog queries are sets of query graphs, called graphical queries. If, when looking at a query graph in a graphical query, we do not find an edge label in the database, then there must exist another query graph in the graphical query defining that edge. The language also supports computing aggregate functions and summarizing along paths.The G+ Visual Query System is currently implemented in Smalltalk-80�, and runs on Sun 3, Sun 4 and Macintosh II workstations. A Graph Editor is available for editing query graphs and displaying database graphs. It supports graph �cutting and pasting�, as well as text editing of node and edge labels, node and edge repositioning and re-shaping, storage and retrieval of graphs as text files, etc. Automatic graph layout is also provided. For editing collections of graphs (such as graphical queries) a Graph Browser is available.The first answer mode supported by the G+ Visual Query System is to return as the result of a GraphLog query a graph with the new edges defined by the graphical query added to the database graph.An alternative way of visualizing answers is by high-lighting on the database graph, one at a time, the paths (or just the nodes) described by the query. This mode is particularly useful to locate interesting starting points for browsing.Rather than viewing the answers superimposed on the database graph, the user may choose to view them in a Graph Browser. The Graph Browser contains the set of subgraphs of the database graph that were found to satisfy the query.Finally, the user may select to collect all the subgraphs of the database graph that satisfy the query together into one new graph. This graph (as well as any other result graph from any of the above mentioned answer modes) in turn may be queried, providing a mechanism for iterative filtering of irrelevant information until a manageable subgraph is obtained.",Alberto O.

In particular, we aim for queries that can be executed efficiently in parallel, using the class NC and its various subclasses as formal models of low parallel complexity.Our approach retains the standard relational notion of relations as sets of tuples, not requiring the introduction of multisets. For the case where no rules are recursive, the language is exactly as expressive as Klug's first order language with aggregates. We show that this class of non-recursive programs cannot express transitive closure (unless LOGSPACE=NLOGSPACE), thus providing evidence for a widely believed but never proven folk result. We also study the expressive power and complexity of languages that support aggregation over recursion.We then describe how these facilities, as well as manipulating the length of paths in database graphs, are incorporated into our visual query language GraphLog. While GraphLog could easily be extended to handle all the queries described above, we prefer to restrict the language in a natural way to avoid explicit recursion; all recursion is expressed as transitive closure.

To believe the validity of the assertion, the verifier must make sure that the two provers can not communicate with each other during the course of the proof process.

To believe the validity of the assertion, the verifier must make sure that the two provers can not communicate with each other during the course of the proof process.

A routing scheme should use as short as possible paths for routing messages in the network, while keeping the routing information stored in the processors' local memory as succinct as possible. The efficiency of a routing scheme is measured in terms of its stretch factor - the maximum ratio between the length of a route computed by the scheme and that of a shortest path connecting the same pair of vertices.Most previous work has concentrated on finding good routing schemes (with a small fixed stretch factor) for special classes of network topologies. In this work we study the problem for general networks, and look at the entire range of possible stretch factors. The results exhibit a tradeoff between the efficiency of a routing scheme and its space requirements. We present almost tight upper and lower bounds for this tradeoff. Specifically, we prove that any routing scheme for general n-vertex networks that achieves a stretch factor k ? 1 must use a total of &OHgr;(n1+1/2k+4) bits of routing information in the networks. This lower bound is complemented by a family H(k) of hierarchical routing schemes (for every fixed k ? 1), which guarantee a stretch factor of &Ogr;(k), require storing a total of &Ogr;(n1+1/k) bits of routing information in the network and name the vertices with &Ogr;(log2 n)-bit names.",Eli Upfal,1032,15

A preflow is like a flow, except that the total amount flowing into a vertex is allowed to exceed the total amount flowing out. The method maintains a preflow in the original network and pushes local flow excess toward the sink along what are estimated to be shortest paths.

To explore this paradigm, a new project at IBM Research was started in 1989 to build a virtual laboratory for scientists and engineers. Our first step is to integrate the glove and space tracking devices with the real time graphics on a graphics superworkstation. A simple bouncing ball virtual world has been created to test underlying software and fine tune interactive performance.Our initial emphasis is placed on understanding the limitations of various system components and getting the best interactive performance from the system. With current state of technology, the glove and tracking devices can generate much more data than the graphics update process can utilize. Both the rendering process and the processes handling the device serial ports are CPU intensive. Our first design problem is how to distribute the processing and match the incoming data rates of input devices with the update rate of the graphics.

Rendering only the potentially visible subset associated with the current viewpoint, rather than the entire model, produces significant speedups on real building models. Solutions for the radiosity lighting model are pre-computed for up to twenty different sets of lights. Linear combinations of these solutions can be manipulated in real time. We use adaptive refinement to trade image realism for interactivity as the situation requires. When the user is stationary we replace a coarse model using few polygons with a more detailed model. Image-level linear interpolation smooths the transition between differing levels of image realism.","Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.",1022,84

More specifically, it is shown how a complete network of processors can deterministically simulate one PRAM step in O(log n/(log log n)2) time when both models use n processors and the size of the PRAM's shared memory is polynomial in n. (The best previously known upper bound was the trivial O(n)). It is established that this upper bound is nearly optimal, and it is proved that an on-line simulation of T PRAM steps by a complete network of processors requires &OHgr;(T(log n/ log log n)) time.A simple consequence of the upper bound is that an Ultracomputer (the currently feasible general-purpose parallel machine) can simulate one step of a PRAM (the most convenient parallel model to program) in O((log n)2log log n) steps.",Avi Wigderson,1038,50
117,118,1032,Eli Upfal,Transfer Learning for Speech Recognition on a Budget,1988,"Two conflicting goals play a crucial role in the design of routing schemes for communication networks. A routing scheme should use as short as possible paths for routing messages in the network, while keeping the routing information stored in the processors' local memory as succinct as possible. The efficiency of a routing scheme is measured in terms of its stretch factor - the maximum ratio between the length of a route computed by the scheme and that of a shortest path connecting the same pair of vertices.Most previous work has concentrated on finding good routing schemes (with a small fixed stretch factor) for special classes of network topologies. In this work we study the problem for general networks, and look at the entire range of possible stretch factors. The results exhibit a tradeoff between the efficiency of a routing scheme and its space requirements. We present almost tight upper and lower bounds for this tradeoff. Specifically, we prove that any routing scheme for general n-vertex networks that achieves a stretch factor k ? 1 must use a total of &OHgr;(n1+1/2k+4) bits of routing information in the networks. This lower bound is complemented by a family H(k) of hierarchical routing schemes (for every fixed k ? 1), which guarantee a stretch factor of &Ogr;(k), require storing a total of &Ogr;(n1+1/k) bits of routing information in the network and name the vertices with &Ogr;(log2 n)-bit names.",David Peleg,1040,15
118,119,1036,Sampath Kannan,Optimizing expected word error rate via sampling for speech recognition,1988,"How to represent a graph in memory is a fundamental data structuring question. In the usual representations of an n-node graph, the names of the nodes (i.e. integers from 1 to n) betray nothing about the graph itself. Indeed, the names (or labels) on the n nodes are just logn bit place holders to allow data on the edges to code for the structure of the graph. In our scenario, there is no such waste. By assigning &Ogr;(logn) bit labels to the nodes, we completely code for the structure of the graph, so that given the labels of two nodes we can test if they are adjacent in time linear in the size of the labels. Furthermore, given an arbitrary original labeling of the nodes, we can find structure coding labels (as above) that are no more than a small constant factor larger than the original labels. These notions are intimately related to vertex induced universal graphs of polynomial size. For example, we can label planar graphs with structure coding labels of size n. This implies the existence of a graph with n4 nodes that contains all n-node planar graphs as vertex induced subgraphs (It was not previously known that this class had polynomial sized universal graphs).

If the offset is used, usually the expansion can be done quickly and in a more global way because it is easier to see effective directions of expansion. The problem with this approach is that there are many functions that have a reasonable size onset and don't care set but the offset is unreasonably large. It was recently shown that for the minimization of such Boolean functions, a new approach using reduced offsets, provides the same global picture and can be computed much faster.

It is fail-safe, maximizes workstation autonomy, and is well suited to a network with slow, unreliable, and/or expensive communications links.The algorithm is a manipulation of queries, which are represented as short encodings. When a response is generated, we record which portion of the source database was used. Later, when the source data are updated, this information is used to identify obsolete replicas. For each workstation, the identity of obsolete replicas is saved until a workstation process asks for this information. This workstation process deletes each obsolete replica, and replaces it by an up-to-date version either promptly or the next time the application asks for this particular item.

Consens,Multilingual Image Description with Neural Sequence Models,1990,"The video presentation �The G+/GraphLog Visual Query System� gives an overview of the capabilities of the ongoing implementation of the G+ Visual Query System for visualizing both data and queries as graphs. The system provides an environment for expressing queries in GraphLog [Con89, CM89, CM90], as well as for browsing, displaying and editing graphs. The visual query system also supports displaying the answers in several different ways.Graphs are a very natural representation for data in many application domains, for example, transportation networks, project scheduling, parts hierarchies, family trees, concept hierarchies, and Hypertext. From a broader perspective, many databases can be naturally viewed as graphs. In particular, any relational database in which we can identify one or more sets of objects of interest and relationships between them can be represented by mapping these objects into nodes and relationships into edges. In the case of semantic and object-oriented databases, there is a natural mapping of objects to nodes and attributes to edges.GraphLog is a visual query language, based on a graph representation of both data and queries, that has evolved from the earlier language G+ [CMW87, CMW89, MW89]. GraphLog queries ask for patterns that must be present or absent in the database graph. Each such pattern, called a query graph, defines new edges that are added to the graph whenever the pattern is found. GraphLog queries are sets of query graphs, called graphical queries. If, when looking at a query graph in a graphical query, we do not find an edge label in the database, then there must exist another query graph in the graphical query defining that edge. The language also supports computing aggregate functions and summarizing along paths.The G+ Visual Query System is currently implemented in Smalltalk-80�, and runs on Sun 3, Sun 4 and Macintosh II workstations. A Graph Editor is available for editing query graphs and displaying database graphs. It supports graph �cutting and pasting�, as well as text editing of node and edge labels, node and edge repositioning and re-shaping, storage and retrieval of graphs as text files, etc. Automatic graph layout is also provided. For editing collections of graphs (such as graphical queries) a Graph Browser is available.The first answer mode supported by the G+ Visual Query System is to return as the result of a GraphLog query a graph with the new edges defined by the graphical query added to the database graph.An alternative way of visualizing answers is by high-lighting on the database graph, one at a time, the paths (or just the nodes) described by the query. This mode is particularly useful to locate interesting starting points for browsing.Rather than viewing the answers superimposed on the database graph, the user may choose to view them in a Graph Browser. The Graph Browser contains the set of subgraphs of the database graph that were found to satisfy the query.Finally, the user may select to collect all the subgraphs of the database graph that satisfy the query together into one new graph. This graph (as well as any other result graph from any of the above mentioned answer modes) in turn may be queried, providing a mechanism for iterative filtering of irrelevant information until a manageable subgraph is obtained.",Alberto O.

In particular, we aim for queries that can be executed efficiently in parallel, using the class NC and its various subclasses as formal models of low parallel complexity.Our approach retains the standard relational notion of relations as sets of tuples, not requiring the introduction of multisets. For the case where no rules are recursive, the language is exactly as expressive as Klug's first order language with aggregates. We show that this class of non-recursive programs cannot express transitive closure (unless LOGSPACE=NLOGSPACE), thus providing evidence for a widely believed but never proven folk result. We also study the expressive power and complexity of languages that support aggregation over recursion.We then describe how these facilities, as well as manipulating the length of paths in database graphs, are incorporated into our visual query language GraphLog. While GraphLog could easily be extended to handle all the queries described above, we prefer to restrict the language in a natural way to avoid explicit recursion; all recursion is expressed as transitive closure. We show that this guarantees all expressible queries are in NC. We analyze other proposals and show that they can express queries that are logspace-complete for P and thus unlikely to be parallelizable efficiently.",Mariano P. Consens,1057,56

In this situation, users may be required to know how the state and the constraints interact before they can retrieve the information correctly.In this paper, the formal notion of embedded-completeness is proposed, and it is shown that schemes with this property avoid the problem described above.

We prove that all NP languages have perfect zero-knowledge proof-systems in this model, without making any intractability assumptions.The generalized interactive-proof model consists of two computationally unbounded and untrusted provers, rather than one, who jointly agree on a strategy to convince the verifier of the truth of an assertion and then engage in a polynomial number of message exchanges with the verifier in their attempt to do so. To believe the validity of the assertion, the verifier must make sure that the two provers can not communicate with each other during the course of the proof process.

It is important at this time to find alternative foundations to the design of secure cryptography. We introduce a new model of generalized interactive proofs as a step in this direction. We prove that all NP languages have perfect zero-knowledge proof-systems in this model, without making any intractability assumptions.The generalized interactive-proof model consists of two computationally unbounded and untrusted provers, rather than one, who jointly agree on a strategy to convince the verifier of the truth of an assertion and then engage in a polynomial number of message exchanges with the verifier in their attempt to do so. To believe the validity of the assertion, the verifier must make sure that the two provers can not communicate with each other during the course of the proof process. Thus, the complexity assumptions made in previous work, have been traded for a physical separation between the two provers.We call this new model the multi-prover interactive-proof model, and examine its properties and applicability to cryptography.",David Peleg,1040,58
151,152,1040,David Peleg,Value Iteration Networks,1988,"Two conflicting goals play a crucial role in the design of routing schemes for communication networks. A routing scheme should use as short as possible paths for routing messages in the network, while keeping the routing information stored in the processors' local memory as succinct as possible. The efficiency of a routing scheme is measured in terms of its stretch factor - the maximum ratio between the length of a route computed by the scheme and that of a shortest path connecting the same pair of vertices.Most previous work has concentrated on finding good routing schemes (with a small fixed stretch factor) for special classes of network topologies. In this work we study the problem for general networks, and look at the entire range of possible stretch factors. The results exhibit a tradeoff between the efficiency of a routing scheme and its space requirements. We present almost tight upper and lower bounds for this tradeoff. Specifically, we prove that any routing scheme for general n-vertex networks that achieves a stretch factor k ? 1 must use a total of &OHgr;(n1+1/2k+4) bits of routing information in the networks. This lower bound is complemented by a family H(k) of hierarchical routing schemes (for every fixed k ? 1), which guarantee a stretch factor of &Ogr;(k), require storing a total of &Ogr;(n1+1/k) bits of routing information in the network and name the vertices with &Ogr;(log2 n)-bit names.",Eli Upfal,1032,15
